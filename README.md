## 🏎️ About Gaslands

Gaslands is a tabletop game of post-apocalyptic vehicular combat created by Mike Hutchinson and published by Osprey Games. Using converted Hot Wheels or Matchbox cars, it simulates a televised bloodsport where drivers compete in a variety of deadly scenarios.

This application is created under the Friends of Gaslands program. Gaslands is © 2017 Mike Hutchinson.

## 🧰 Development

- Basic understanding of TypeScript, Svelte, and web development

### Repository Structure

- `/app`: Svelte-based web application frontend
  - `/src/data/rules`: Game rule definitions (vehicles, weapons, perks, sponsors)
  - `/src/lib/draft`: Functions for encoding/decoding team builds
  - `/src/lib/rules`: Types and loaders for game rules
  - `/src/lib/validate`: Validation logic for team builds
  - `/src/routes`: Svelte routes and components
- `/infra`: AWS CDK infrastructure for deployment
- `/validate`: Core validation logic (shared)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/joseanes/gaslands-garage.git
   cd gaslands-garage
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd app
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start the development server with browser open
cd app && pnpm dev -- --open

# Type checking
cd app && pnpm check

# Watch mode type checking
cd app && pnpm check:watch

# Run tests
cd app && pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
cd app && pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
cd app && pnpm test:coverage
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build the application
cd app && pnpm build

# Preview the production build
cd app && pnpm preview
```

### Firebase Deployment

```bash
# Deploy Firestore security rules
cd app && node deploy-firebase-rules.mjs

# Or using Firebase CLI directly:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project=gaslandsgarage-74ce6
```

### Infrastructure Deployment (AWS)

```bash
# Build the infrastructure
cd infra && pnpm build

# Deploy the infrastructure to AWS
cd infra && npx cdk deploy

# Compare deployed stack with current state
cd infra && npx cdk diff
```

## 📐 Software Architecture

### Core Architecture Principles

Gaslands Garage follows a component-based architecture with a clear separation of concerns:

1. **Rules System**: The core ruleset is defined in static JSON files and validated using Zod schemas
2. **State Management**: All team state is managed in the main builder page with reactive updates
3. **Validation Engine**: A dedicated validator ensures team builds follow Gaslands rules
4. **Team Serialization**: Draft encoding/decoding system for sharing teams via URLs and QR codes

### Data Flow

1. **User Actions**: The user selects sponsors, vehicles, weapons, and upgrades in the Svelte UI
2. **State Updates**: These changes update the reactive state in the builder page component
3. **Validation**: The validation engine continuously validates the team against the game rules
4. **Cost Calculation**: The `calculateTotalCansDirectly` function computes the total cost of all vehicles and components
5. **Metrics**: The Coach component analyzes team composition for combat effectiveness, survivability, etc.

### Key Component Interactions

- **Builder Page (`/routes/builder/+page.svelte`)**: Central component managing team state and UI
- **Team Loading (`importDraftFn`)**: Handles importing teams from various sources (URL, string, or saved teams)
- **Validation (`validateDraft` in `/lib/validate/index.ts`)**: Validates teams against game rules
- **Coach Component**: Analyzes team metrics and provides optimization suggestions
- **Print Service**: Handles different print styles and formats for physical reference cards

### Code Structure

- **Data Models**: Defined in `/lib/rules/types.ts` using Zod schemas
- **Rule Loaders**: Functions in `/lib/rules/loadRules.ts` load and parse game data
- **Validation Logic**: Split between calculation (`calc.ts`) and rule checks (`checks.ts`)
- **Team Import/Export**: Encoding/decoding in `/lib/draft/io.ts`
- **Services**: Firebase integration for user authentication and team storage

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Common Issues

1. **Missing totalCans Calculation**: When loading a team, ensure `calculateTotalCansDirectly()` is called
2. **Validation Errors**: The validator may block invalid components; check the console for detailed messages
3. **Weapon Instance IDs**: Weapons use an `originalId_instanceId` format that needs special parsing

#### Reactive Update Debugging

The application uses Svelte's reactive system. Key reactive statements:
- `$: totalCans = calculateTotalCansDirectly();` recalculates costs when dependencies change
- `$: if (sponsorId && sponsorId !== lastSponsorId) {...}` handles sponsor-specific validation

When updating the codebase, ensure recalculation happens at all entry points where teams are loaded or modified.
